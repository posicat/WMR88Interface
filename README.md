# WMR88Interface
Interface library for the Oregon WMR100/WMR88/WMR88A weather station

Derived from https://github.com/xilodyne/WxCenter-WMR88-JavaGUI and http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kjt/software/comms/wxlogger.html

This project is to turn the standalone server WxLoggerToHost into a library that other projects can easily import to access the Oregon Scientific WMR88/WMR100 series weather stations.  It may be compatible with other Oregon brand weatherstations, if you are aware of others that it works with, please let me know and I will build a document tracking compatbility.  If you can add compatibility for other models, or even better brands of weather stations, please let me know and we can expand this project together.

Anyone who's using this code, if you find any errors, please send in a detailed descriotion of what should be happening (AKA data displayed on the station screen) what is actually happening, and a capture of the frames that aren't being decoded properly (if relevant).
