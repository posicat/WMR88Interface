# WMR88Interface
Interface library for the Oregon WMR88/WMR88A weather station

Derived from https://github.com/xilodyne/WxCenter-WMR88-JavaGUI with permission.  

This project is to turn the standalone server WxLoggerToHost into a library that other projects can easily import to access the WMR88 series weather stations.  It may be compatible with other Oregon brand weatherstations, if you are aware of others that it works with, please let me know and I will build a document tracking compatbility.  If you can add compatibility for other models, or even better brands of weather stations, please let me know and we can expand this project together.
